1. External power supply from 8 to 35V or 5V USB (provided through the ESP32 board).

2. Using the 3-pin header JP4, the source of the board's 3.3V can be selectedâ€”either from the external power supply or directly from the ESP32 board (powered via USB).

3. Two optocoupled inputs ranging from 5 to 24V (connected to D26 and D27, which can be disconnected via their respective jumpers).

4. Two relay outputs rated at 5A 250Vac or 5A 30Vdc (connected to D4 and D2, and can be disconnected via their respective jumpers).

5. Four push buttons: B1, B2, B3, and B4 (wired to D33, D35, D34, and D32 respectively).

6. Buzzer BUZ1 (connected to D15, with the option to disconnect it via a jumper).

7. Rotary potentiometer RV1 (connected to VP).

8. Connector RT1 for an NTC 10K thermistor temperature sensor (connected to VN).

9. Two Mosfet transistor outputs rated for 36V, 5A (connected to D23 and D19, with jumper-based disconnection).

10. AC dimmer for 220V 5A operation, including:
   - Zero-crossing detector (connected to D5).
   - Power Triac with optocoupled triggering (connected to D18).
   Both signals can be disabled via their respective jumpers.

11. Four user LEDs (connected to D15, D13, D12, and D14, which can be enabled or disabled via the ENL jumper).

12. Real-Time Clock DS1307 connected to:
   - D22 for SCL (I2C interface with ESP32).
   - D21 for SDA (I2C interface with ESP32).
   - D32 for the SOUT line of the DS1307.
   Includes a battery holder for a CR2032 or CR2025 coin cell.

13. I2C header for OLED display connection:
   - GND = GND
   - 3V3 = 3.3V
   - SCL = SCL line (I2C interface with ESP32)
   - SDA = SDA line (I2C interface with ESP32)

14. I2C header for accessing:
   - 3V3 = 3.3V
   - GND = GND
   - SCL (D22) = SCL line (I2C interface with ESP32)
   - SDA (D21) = SDA line (I2C interface with ESP32)

15. COM header for serial communication:
   - 3V3 = 3.3V
   - GND = GND
   - RX2 (D16) = RX2 line (ESP32)
   - TX2 (D17) = TX2 line (ESP32)

16. DAC1 header for accessing:
   - GND = GND
   - 3V3 = 3.3V
   - D25 = Analog output from Digital-to-Analog Converter 1 (DAC1)

17. DHT11 header for sensor connection:
   - GND = GND
   - 3V3 = 3.3V
   - D13 = Data line for the DHT11 sensor (can be disconnected via a jumper)

18. J15 header for accessing the 3.3V supply of the training board.

19. Male 3-pin header (Signal, Vcc, and GND) for accessing all I/O lines. 
This allows fast connections to various sensor modules and servomotors. 
The Vcc lines (V1 and V2) of each I/O set can be set to 3.3V or 5V via the JP1 and JP2 3-pin headers.
